The Guardian ran a beautiful competition to write [a description of Dumbledore's death in the style of another author](http://books.guardian.co.uk/potter/page/0,13381,1521782,00.html). I particularly liked one in the syle of [Gabriel Garcia Marquez](http://books.guardian.co.uk/harrypotter/story/0,10761,1529472,00.html):

”...everybody said for one hundred years after that Dumbledore saw it coming and let it sink into his flesh; he had taken another man’s women and he now owned her heart completely, and she his; and no amount of quick knives in the hands of small men would change that.”
