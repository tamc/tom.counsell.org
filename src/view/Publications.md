I’ve been involved in four Carbon Trust publications:

1.  [Global Carbon Mechanisms: Emerging lessons and implications](http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/publications/publicationdetail.htm?productid=CTC748)
2.  [Climate change – a business revolution?](http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/publications/publicationdetail?productid=CTC740)
3.  [Cutting Carbon in Europe: The 2020 plans and the future of the EU ETS](http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/publications/publicationdetail?productid=CTC734)
4.  [EU ETS impacts on profitability and trade: a sector by sector analysis](http://www.carbontrust.co.uk/publications/publicationdetail.htm?productid=CTC728)

# PhD Publications

Some of the material in my PhD thesis has been published in Journals and presented at conferences. In all cases my supervisor, Julian Allwood, was co-author:
