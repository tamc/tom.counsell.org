Wow. I had underestimated just how bad they are. Toyota have just launched the [RV 400h](http://www.lexus.co.uk/lexus_cars/rx/rx400h). It does [34.9 mpg](http://www.lexus.co.uk/lexus_cars/rx/rx400h/specifications/specifications_index.asp?model=RX%20400h&spec=PERFORMANCE+DATA). The Yaris that I drive has averaged more than 50 mpg. The depressing difference? The Yaris is a straight peterol engine. The RV 400h is a hybrid petrol-electric using technology that is about as good environmentally as you can get on the road. Clearly SUVs are too, too heavy and their use should be restricted to those whose daily work is on unpaved roads…

Still, it is clearly better than current SUVs, and if everyone who owns an SUV switches to one, the world will be a better place, even if not the best place.

I’m getting to think that every car should be required to display its current fuel consumption in large digits on the central dash, to make people think about what they are using.
