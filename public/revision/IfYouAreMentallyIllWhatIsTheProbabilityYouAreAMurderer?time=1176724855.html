						<li><del>2. With regard to the proposed mental health bill going through the UK parliament today, I find it interesting that:</del></li>

						<li><del>4. * 50 mentally ill people commit a homicide each year ([[Department of Health =&gt; http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=267945&NewsAreaID=2&NavigatedFromDepartment=False]])</del></li>
					
				
						<li>2. With regard to the proposed mental health bill going through the UK parliament today:</li>
					
				
		
				
						<li><del>6. So, if you are mentally ill enough to have your liberty removed, we can be 99.6% sure that you are not about to commit a homicide.</del></li>
					
				
						<li>4. I find it interesting that according to the [[Department of Health =&gt; http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Policyandguidance/Healthandsocialcaretopics/Mentalhealth/DH_4132141]] ministerial statement: 1 in 6 people suffer from a mental illness in a given year.</li>
					
				
		
				
						<li><del>8. An interesting number in another [[Department of Health =&gt; http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Policyandguidance/Healthandsocialcaretopics/Mentalhealth/DH_4132141]] ministerial statement: 1 in 6 people are suffering from a mental illness at any one time.</del></li>
					
				
						<li>6. According to another [[Department of Health =&gt; http://www.gnn.gov.uk/environment/fullDetail.asp?ReleaseID=267945&NewsAreaID=2&NavigatedFromDepartment=False]] statement 50 homicides a year are committed by the mentally ill. Given there are roughly [[800 =&gt; http://www.crimestatistics.org.uk/output/Page40.asp]] homicides a year in the UK that means 1 in 16 homicidal people are mentally ill. </li>
					
				
		
				
						<li><del>10. Given that 50 of the roughly 800 UK homicides a year, 1 in 16 homicidal people are mentally ill. Less than the going rate in the population. So, rational people are more likely to commit murder than those who are not.</del></li>

						<li>10. But any little helps eh? and if you are one of the 14,000 people a year who will have their liberty constrained under the bill (A BBC [[figure =&gt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6558529.stm]], no idea as to the source) at least we can be 99.6% sure that you are not about to kill someone.</li>
