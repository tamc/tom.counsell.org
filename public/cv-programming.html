    <a class='image' href='http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk'><img src='/static/2050.png' /></a>

    <p>An <a href='http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk'>online tool</a> that allows people to explore the future of the UK's energy system and has been in continuous operation since 2010. I wrote all the code, mostly in Ruby and Javascript with some C. Key features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/tamc/excel_to_code'>Code</a> that takes an Excel spreadsheet and translates it into an equivalent model written in C.</li>
      <li><a href='http://github.com/decc/twenty-fifty'>Code</a> to interface between the C library and the javascript in the browser</li>
      <li>Bespoke javascript <a href='http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk'>controls and charts</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>User management, blog posts and event listings.</li>
      <li>A mailing list system, including archives.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>User management, including interfacing to the early University of Cambridge Single Sign On system.</li>
      <li>A clever but complex alternative to tagging (talks could appear on any number of lists. Lists could contain other lists.)</li>
