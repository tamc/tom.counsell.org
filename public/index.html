<p>Hello. I'm an engineer. At the moment I run the bit of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change">the Department of Energy and Climate Change</a>'s strategy team that worries about the long-term. Before that I was an assistant to <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/">David MacKay</a>, the department's Chief Scientific Advisor.</p>
<p>For the first year of my time at DECC I was seconded from the <a href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk">Carbon Trust</a>. I worked for them from October 2007 in the Insights team, which meant I worked on <a href="view/Publications.html">publications</a> that they produced on tricky climate change topics and helped them figure out how to improve what the Carbon Trust did.</p>
<p>Before that I was studying for a <a href="view/Phd.html">PhD</a> at <a href="http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk">Clare College</a>, <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge University</a>. My research was with the <a href="http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/pp/">Production Processes Group</a> of the <a href="http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk">Manufacturing Division</a> of the <a href="http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk">Engineering Department</a>. My supervisor was <a href="http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/jma42/">Julian Allwood</a>. I was also the teaching assistant on the <a href="http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/met">Manufacturing Engineering Tripos</a> course.</p>
