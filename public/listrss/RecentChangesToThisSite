Abstract &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;This thesis reports on experiments into whether abra- &lt;br /&gt;sives, lasers or solvents can remove ordinary black toner- &lt;br /&gt;print from ordinary white oﬃce paper in a way that leaves &lt;br /&gt;the paper reusable. If it could be ‘un-printed’ then waste &lt;br /&gt;oﬃce-paper could be reused immediately, without the need &lt;br /&gt;for recycling. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;Paper and board consumption causes approximately &lt;br /&gt;1% of man-made climate change gas emissions. Estimates &lt;br /&gt;in the ﬁrst chapter suggest that un-printing could reduce &lt;br /&gt;emissions per tonne of oﬃce paper by up to 95% – greater &lt;br /&gt;than the potential from incineration, localisation, annual &lt;br /&gt;ﬁbre, ﬁbre recycling, un-printing or electronic paper. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;There has been no academic work on un-printing, but &lt;br /&gt;some relevant patents have been ﬁled. The second chapter &lt;br /&gt;reviews these patents according to whether they remove, &lt;br /&gt;obscure or de-colour the original print. It is not clear from &lt;br /&gt;the patents whether toner-print can be removed by abra- &lt;br /&gt;sives, lasers, or solvents without rendering the paper un- &lt;br /&gt;usable. These three approaches are tested experimentally &lt;br /&gt;and the results reported in chapters 3, 4 &amp; 5. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;Abrasives can remove toner-print with limited dam- &lt;br /&gt;age to the underlying paper by operating in an adhesive &lt;br /&gt;wear regime. This involves making ten passes with a ﬁne &lt;br /&gt;P800 abrasive rubbing at high speeds (6 m/s) and low loads &lt;br /&gt;(0.3 N). Longer wavelength lasers are able to remove the &lt;br /&gt;toner-print and leave blank paper undamaged by operating &lt;br /&gt;at 1 W and 10 kHz in the 1064 nm wavelength and scanning &lt;br /&gt;across the surface eight times at 400 mm/s. Unfortunately &lt;br /&gt;the paper beneath the print is yellowed during removal. &lt;br /&gt;A 40:60 mixture chloroform and dimethylsulfoxide eﬀec- &lt;br /&gt;tively dissolves toner without dissolving paper if agitated &lt;br /&gt;with ultrasound for four minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;Chapter 6 outlines the research required to make the &lt;br /&gt;approaches feasible replacements for conventional paper re- &lt;br /&gt;cycling. The abrasive approach requires research into ex- &lt;br /&gt;tending abrasive life. The laser approach requires research &lt;br /&gt;into avoiding paper yellowing. The solvent approach re- &lt;br /&gt;quires research into benign solvents and solvent recycling. &lt;br /&gt;All three approaches would need to be tested on a wider &lt;br /&gt;range of prints and papers. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;Content was also deleted&lt;br /&gt;[[ insert publications ]]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;Content was also deleted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ insert my publications ]]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;The hypothesis of this project is that it may be possible to overcome these problems by using a different approach to removing ink that does not damage the paper and could be operated within and office.  A machine suitable for an office of about 70 people would need to be able to clean the print off about 1.5 tonnes of paper a year, at a rate of one sheet every minute and a half, at a total cost of less than �1400 a year (implying a maximum capital cost of around �7000).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;The work is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Councill (EPSRC).
