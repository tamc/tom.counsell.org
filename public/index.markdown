Hello. I'm an engineer. I live in [Brighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton) in the UK. I work for an American charity called [Give Directly](https://givedirectly.org) that gives no-strings-attached cash to the poorest people, mostly in Africa, to eliminate extreme poverty.

Before that I worked at a small firm in [Lewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes) [that helps children's nurseries](http://eyfs.info) and whose main product was [Tapestry](https://tapestry.info), an online learning journal. Before that, I was a Deputy Director at the UK [Department
of Energy and Climate Change][decc]. I also do occasional freelance work through [Green on Black Ltd][gnb].

1.  My wife, [Professor Catherine Marijke Will](https://easst.net/easst-review/44-1/catherine-will-symposium/) died. Life is tough.
1.  I have joined [Give Directly](https://givedirectly.org) a charity I've admired for years that, because of COVID, now employs developers outside of New York.
1.  I left [Tapestry](https://tapestry.info). Not because I didn't love Tapestry, but becaues my wife has cancer and I need time to care for her and the kids.
1.  I've enjoyed making a [server load monitor](programming/usermeter/index.html) out of a 65 year old ammeter for my boss.
1.  Very sad that [David MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._C._MacKay) has died. He taught me so much. 
1.  I helped the Australian [Food, Energy, Environment and Water Network](http://www.fe2wnetwork.org) turn their Excel model of Food and Water scenarios into an [interactive site](http://gfws.fe2wnetwork.org).
1.  I have left DECC. Not because I didn't like DECC. But because I have had enough of commuting from Brighton to London. I'm now working at a tiny local firm [that helps children's nurseries](http://eyfs.info),
1.  Almost my last act at DECC was to create [short film about how we supply and use energy in the UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnNwBpre3Lk). It was based on a talk I gave last year in London.
1.  I don't like [Marginal Abatement Cost Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_abatement_cost), but some colleagues at DECC really do. They are also annoying to do in Excel, so I created a [chart generator](http://tamc.github.io/macc/) to help them out.
1.  Created a ['flying brick'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_chart) [chart generator](http://tamc.github.io/flying-brick/) because they are a bit annoying to draw in Excel.
1.  Together with [ITRI](https://www.itri.org.tw) we hosted a conference in Taipei for [all the countries](http://www.2050.org.uk/#!calculators/cee5) that are working on 2050 calculators. [Premier Mao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Chi-kuo) opened the event, and an awesome group of high school children put on a play about the difficulty of agreeing what to do about energy in Taiwan.
1.  We're writing a [book on how to make a 2050 calculator](http://book.2050.org.uk).
1.  Some great responses to the launch of our [Global Calculator](http://www.globalcalculator.org). One of my favourites is the headline of the article in the Telegraph: "[Hate wind farms? Eat chicken, not beef](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/climatechange/11373389/Hate-wind-farms-Eat-chicken.html)."
1.  Created an [automatic marginal abatement cost curve generator](http://alt-global-calc.2050.org.uk/macc/) for the [Global Calculator](http://www.globalcalculator.org).
1.  Produced a [Cates plot for statins showing side effects](http://bl.ocks.org/tamc/raw/024168df8660eeca26aa/) for my wife's blog post.
1.  My team have released a draft [Global Calculator](http://www.globalcalculator.org) that allows you to try out different standards of living and the energy system that supports them, and then see the consequences for climate change and fossil fuel reserves. We are looking for expert feedback on the draft, so we can make it awesome in time for a December release. I [blogged about it at DECC](http://blog.decc.gov.uk/2014/07/21/poke-it-prod-it-break-it-help-us-to-make-a-great-global-calculator/).

1.  With my team's help, India have [launched their version of a 2050 calculator](http://indiaenergy.gov.in). They have done a great job with their documentation. I blogged about it at [DECC](http://blog.decc.gov.uk/2014/03/04/not-how-they-do-it-on-yes-minister/)
1.  My team won a second [Civil Service Award](http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/reform/civil-service-awards-2013/) for Analysis and Use of Evidence, joint with the Foreign Office. Well done guys.

1.  I am quite proud of the legends on the [new charts in the 2050 calculator](http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk). Did them in [D3](http://d3js.org) which was a pleasure. [See the code](https://github.com/decc/twenty-fifty/blob/master/src/javascripts/stacked_area_chart.js.coffee).
1.  My team has started to develop a 2050 calculator [for the world](http://globalcalculator.org/), watch the [video message's about the project](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLar0SlGyNQ8tFLdWYMnVUvRWbeIAXVIRY).

You can [listen](http://www.hayfestival.com/p-6114-kate-humble-richard-smith-marcus-du-sautoy-and-mark-watson.aspx) to it or read about it [on the DECC blog](http://blog.decc.gov.uk/2013/06/07/2050-at-the-hay-festival/).
4.  At the last minute, I stepped in to replace David MacKay at the first [British Energy Challenge](http://blog.decc.gov.uk/category/the-british-energy-challenge/) roadshow in Liverpool. [Watch the highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3B_cK2osIA).
4.  I blogged on the DECC blog about [China's 2050 Calculator](http://blog.decc.gov.uk/2012/09/18/some-copying-is-great/) ([local copy](/2050/some-copying-is-great.html))  and the [common problem of consensus](http://blog.decc.gov.uk/2012/09/26/the-common-problem-of-consensus/) ([local copy](/2050/2012-09-26-the-common-problem-of-consensus.html)).
