Hello. I'm an engineer. At the moment I run the bit of [the Department
of Energy and Climate Change][decc]'s strategy team
that worries about the long-term. Before that I was an assistant to
[David MacKay](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/), the
department's Chief Scientific Advisor.

For the first year of my time at DECC I was seconded from the [Carbon
Trust](http://www.carbontrust.co.uk). I worked for them from October
2007 in the Insights team, which meant I worked on
[publications](view/Publications.html) that they produced on tricky
climate change topics and helped them figure out how to improve what the
Carbon Trust did.

Before that I was studying for a [PhD](view/Phd.html) at [Clare
College](http://www.clare.cam.ac.uk), [Cambridge
University](http://www.cam.ac.uk). My research was with the [Production
Processes Group](http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/pp/) of the [Manufacturing
Division](http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk) of the [Engineering
Department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk). My supervisor was [Julian
Allwood](http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/jma42/). I was also the
teaching assistant on the [Manufacturing Engineering
Tripos](http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/met) course.
