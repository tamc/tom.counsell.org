		<h2>CHIEF ENGINEER (2015&ndash;)</h2>

		<p>Our firm, The Foundation Stage Forum, helps nurseries & primary schools to nurture their kids and connect
			with parents.</p>

		<p>Until mid-2021, I was in charge of the firm's product (known as Tapestry), £1&thinsp;million annual
			infrastructure
			spend, and nine
			software engineers. I worked directly with the founders on most aspects of the business and helped
			them
			grow the firm from a few people camped in the founder's house to a solid business that cares for just
			over a million children while remaining profitable, reliable, secure and
			loved.</p>

		<p>In mid-2021, my wife fell seriously ill and I took a step back in order to care for her and for my children.
			I remain involved and
			love this business but no longer manage the team or product day-to-day.</p>

		<h2>CONSULTANT (2015&ndash;)</h2>

		<p>In my spare time, I provide advice and hands-on support to several groups: to fix troublesome analysis so
			that it provides useful answers and to present the results in a way that is engaging and useful. I have
			particular expertise in turning Excel-based analysis into interactive online tools.</p>

		<h2>CIVIL SERVANT (2010&ndash;2015)</h2>

		<p>I held five posts at the UK Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change</p>

		<h3>Deputy Director, Analysis</h3>

		<p>Reporting to the Chief Economist, I acted as an analytic troubleshooter. In particular, I helped the team
			move from a traditional approach of considering a few long-range energy scenarios to being able to look for
			the common features, level of uncertainty and interesting exceptions amongst thousands of automatically
			generated scenarios.</p>

		<h3>Deputy Director, International Climate Change</h3>

		<p>I ran a nine-person team and £2&thinsp;million programme providing advice to other governments on how to
			think about the future of their energy systems. The team won a Civil Service Award, jointly with the Foreign
			Office, for their approach.</p>

		<p>Due to the departure of a colleague I also briefly &amp; simultaneously managed another team during a
			challenging period. I was responsible for an additional thirty staff and £200&thinsp;million of overseas
			development aid.</p>

		<h3>Deputy Director, Strategy</h3>

		<p>I ran a twelve-person team that considered what needed to be done to meet the department's long term targets.
			The team won a Civil Service Award for its ground-breaking approach.</p>

		<h3>Grade 6, Head of Engineering Team</h3>

		<p>I formed and ran the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change's first central engineering team. This team of
			ten spanned the engineering disciplines and provided technical advice to the department on carbon capture
			&amp; storage, bioenergy sustainability, nuclear research, spending to support innovation, the potential for
			energy demand reduction and the challenges of renewables deployment.</p>

		<h3>Grade 7, Assistant to the Chief Scientific Advisor</h3>

		<p>I was recruited to the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change by David MacKay, the Chief Scientific
			Advisor, to work in his private office. I supported him with counsel, with rapid bits of analysis, in
			keeping track of initiatives inside and outside of the department and I represented him when he was
			unavailable.</p>

		<h2>STRATEGY MANAGER (2007&ndash;2010)</h2>

		<p>I was appointed as a strategy associate and then promoted to strategy manager at the Carbon Trust. I managed
			internal and external staff to create well received publications on climate change topics (four on the EU
			ETS with Michael Grub, one on the impact of tackling climate change on shareholder value and one on the
			scale of emissions triggered abroad by UK consumption of goods) and to help the CEO and COO to define
			elements of the Carbon Trust’s organisation and strategy (for example, how should the Carbon Trust support
			other governments in setting up Carbon Trust-like organisations? What could the Carbon Trust do to stimulate
			a green economic recovery?). I represented the Carbon Trust to industry and to government in the UK and
			abroad. I kept Carbon Trust staff briefed on policy developments, such as the work of the Climate Change
			Committee, the carbon targets and budgets, and the Low Carbon Transition Plan.</p>

		<h2>ENGINEERING RESEARCHER (2003&ndash;2007)</h2>
		<p>I completed a PhD under the supervision of Dr Julian Allwood at the Department of Engineering at the
			University of Cambridge. I won personal funding for the research which considered whether it would be
			possible
			to remove print from paper in a way that would allow used sheets to be fed back into a printer and
			immediately reused. During this research I explored three distinct fields: solvents, in collaboration with
			the Department of Chemistry; lasers, in collaboration with the Bavarian Laser Centre and the Centre for
			Industrial Photonics; and high speed wear, in collaboration with the Production Processes Group. I published
			four peer-reviewed journal articles. </p>

		<h2>ENGINEERING TEACHER (2003&ndash;2007)</h2>

		<p>I was appointed as a teaching assistant at the Cambridge University Engineering Department. I led visits,
			practicals, workshops and educational games for third- and fourth-year engineering students. I marked
			essays. I prepared and delivered lectures on, for example, industrial sustainability, the Toyota Production
			System, and process mapping. I supervised undergraduate engineers on materials science, on the organisation
			and control of manufacturing systems and on mathematics.</p>

		<h2>STRATEGY CONSULTANT (2000&ndash;2003)</h2>
		<p>I was appointed as an associate consultant and then promoted to consultant (their post-MBA level) at Marakon
			Associates. I managed small consulting teams and large groups of clients to answer questions of strategy and
			organisation. For example: I helped the CEO of a Canadian chocolate business to cut costs; I helped the CEO
			of an over the counter drugs business to understand the options for the growth, merger or sale of his
			business; and I helped a wholesale bank to fix its ineffective, multi-country, matrix organisation. My role
			became one of analytical trouble-shooter sent in to give drifting projects traction. Most work was done
			overseas.</p>

		<h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEER (1995&ndash;)</h2>
		<p>While studying, I ran a small software business. I developed: one of the first content management systems for
			the web; a prototype electronic health record system; several platforms for booking events; several wikis; a
			popular system for finding out what seminars and talks are happening at the University of Cambridge; and an
			iPhone application to help breastfeeding mothers.</p>

		<h2>PROJECT MANAGER (1995&ndash;2000)</h2>
		<p>I was sponsored through university as a project manager in the Defence Engineering and Science Group, part of
			the Ministry of Defence. I ran small technical projects for Westland aerospace special projects; the Guided
			Weapons and Surveillance Technical Support group and the Battle Group Battle Management Systems team.</p>
