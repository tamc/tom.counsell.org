<h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEER (2015&ndash;)</h2>

<p>I help a small firm grow and make a difference to the way that children's nurseries help their kids to develop.</p>

<p>I am in charge of the firm's technology, manage a team of six engineers, and work directly with the founders on most aspects of the business. In particular, I have: managed their transition to the cloud, allowing them to double in size while improving performance and reliability; managed their approach to dealing with GDPR compliance, delivering the `best work they have seen` in the eyes of several of our customer's data protection officers; improved the software development processes to continuously deliver the right improvements as the size of the team has grown; supported the founders in making difficult decisions around staffing, pricing and international expansion.</p>

<h2>CONSULTANT (2015&ndash;)</h2>

<p>In my spare time I provide advice and hands-on support to several groups: to fix troublesome analysis so that it provides useful answers and to present the results in a way that is engaging and useful. I have particular expertise in turning Excel based analysis into interactive online tools.</p>

<h2>CIVIL SERVANT (2010&ndash;2015)</h2>

<p>I held five posts at the UK Department of Energy & Climate Change</p>

<h3>Deputy Director, Analysis</h3>

<p>Reporting to the Chief Economist, I acted as an analytic trouble shooter. In particular, I helped the team move from a traditional approach of considering a few long-range energy scenarios to being able to look for the common features, level of uncertainty and interesting exceptions amongst thousands of automatically generated scenarios.</p>


<h3>Deputy Director, International Climate Change</h3>

<p>I ran a nine person team and £2&thinsp;million programme providing advice to other governments on how to think about the future of their energy systems. The team won a Civil Service Award, jointly with the Foreign Office, for their approach.</p>

<p>Due to the departure of a colleague I also briefly & simultaneously managed another team during a challenging period. I was responsible for an additional thirty staff and £200&thinsp;million of overseas development aid.</p>


<h3>Deputy Director, Strategy</h3>

<p>I ran a twelve person team that considered what needed to be done to meet the department's long term targets. The team won a Civil Service Award for its ground-breaking approach.</p>

<h3>Grade 6, Head of Engineering Team</h3>

<p>I formed and ran the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change's first central engineering team. This team of ten spanned the engineering disciplines and provided technical advice to the department on carbon capture & storage, bioenergy sustainability, nuclear research, spending to support innovation, the potential for energy demand reduction and the challenges of renewables deployment.</p>

<h3>Grade 7, Assistant to the Chief Scientific Advisor</h3>

<p>I was recruited to the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change by David MacKay, the Chief Scientific Advisor, to work in his private office. I supported him with counsel, with rapid bits of analysis, in keeping track of initiatives inside and outside of the department and represented him when he was unavailable.</p>

<h2>STRATEGY MANAGER (2007&ndash;2010)</h2>

<p>I was appointed as a strategy associate and then promoted to strategy manager at the Carbon Trust. I managed internal and external staff to create well received publications on climate change topics (four on the EU ETS with Michael Grub, one on the impact of tackling climate change on shareholder value and one on the scale of emissions triggered abroad by UK consumption of goods) and to help the CEO and COO to define elements of the Carbon Trust’s organisation and strategy (for example, how should the Carbon Trust support other governments in setting up Carbon Trust-like organisations? What could the Carbon Trust do to stimulate a green economic recovery?). I represented the Carbon Trust to industry and to government in the UK and abroad. I kept Carbon Trust staff briefed on policy developments, such the work of the Climate Change Committee, the carbon targets and budgets and the Low Carbon Transition Plan.</p>

<h2>ENGINEERING RESEARCHER (2003&ndash;2007)</h2>
<p>I completed a PhD under the supervision of Dr Julian Allwood at the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I won funding for my research on the basis of my proposal and academic background. My research considered whether it would be possible
to remove print from paper in a way that would allow used sheets to be fed back into a printer or photocopier and immediately reused. During this research I explored three distinct fields: solvents, in collaboration with the Department of Chemistry; lasers, in collaboration with the Bavarian Laser Centre and the Centre for Industrial Photonics; and high speed wear, in collaboration with the Production Processes Group. I published four peer reviewed journal articles. </p>

<h2>ENGINEERING TEACHER (2003&ndash;2007)</h2>

<p>I was appointed as a teaching assistant at the Cambridge University Engineering Department. I led visits, practicals, workshops and educational games for third and fourth year engineering students. I marked essays. I prepared and delivered lectures on, for example, industrial sustainability, the Toyota Production System, and process mapping. I supervised undergraduate engineers on materials science, on the organisation and control of manufacturing systems and on mathematics.</p>

<h2>STRATEGY CONSULTANT (2000&ndash;2003)</h2>
<p>I was appointed as an associate consultant and then promoted to consultant (their post-MBA level) at Marakon Associates. I managed small consulting teams and large groups of clients to answer questions of strategy and organisation. For example: I helped the CEO of a Canadian chocolate business to cut costs; I helped the CEO of an over the counter drugs business to understand the options for the growth, merger or sale of his business; and I helped a wholesale bank to fix its ineffective, multi-country, matrix organisation. My role became one of analytical trouble-shooter sent in to give drifting projects traction. Most work was done overseas.</p>

<h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEER  (1995&ndash;)</h2>
<p>While studying, I ran a small software business. I developed: one of the first content management systems for the web; a prototype electronic health record system; several platforms for booking events; several wikis; a popular system for finding out what seminars and talks are happening at the University of Cambridge; and an iPhone application to help breastfeeding mothers.</p>

<h2>PROJECT MANAGER (1995&ndash;2000)</h2>
<p>I was sponsored through university as a project manager in the Defence Engineering and Science Group, part of the Ministry of Defence. I ran small technical projects for Westland aerospace special projects; the Guided Weapons and Surveillance Technical Support group and the Battle Group Battle Management Systems team.</p>
