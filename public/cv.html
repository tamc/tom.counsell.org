		<h2>SENIOR ENGINEER (2022&ndash;)</h2>

		<p>I work for <a href='https://givedirectly.org'>GiveDirectly</a>, a charity that gives cash to those in poverty,
			mostly in Africa.</p>

		<p>I work mostly on fundraising, mostly on the $46&thinsp;million in donations we receive each year from small
			donors. I write code to give our donors a good experience, ensure we know who they are, reduce fraud and,
			increasingly, internal tools to reduce our costs. I took over a mess of legacy and volunteer-created systems,
			and after a year I was promoted to be in charge of the (tiny) fundraising-tech team.</p>

		<h2>CHIEF ENGINEER (2015&ndash;2022)</h2>

		<p>I worked for The Foundation Stage Forum, a firm that helps nurseries & primary schools to nurture their kids and
			connect with parents.</p>

		<p>I was in charge of the firm's product (known as Tapestry), £1&thinsp;million annual infrastructure spend, and
			nine software engineers. I worked directly with the founders on most aspects of the business, writing code that
			helped them grow the firm from a few people camped in the founders' house to a solid business that cares for just
			over a million children while remaining profitable, reliable, secure and loved.</p>

		<h2>CIVIL SERVANT (2010&ndash;2015)</h2>

		<p>I held five posts at the UK Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change:</p>

		<h3>Deputy Director, Analysis</h3>

		<p>Reporting to the Chief Economist, I acted as an analytic troubleshooter. In particular, I wrote code to help the
			team
			move from a traditional approach of considering a few long-range energy scenarios to being able to look for
			the common features, level of uncertainty and interesting exceptions amongst thousands of automatically
			generated scenarios.</p>

		<h3>Deputy Director, International Climate Change</h3>

		<p>I ran a nine-person team and £2&thinsp;million programme providing advice to other governments on how to
			think about the future of their energy systems. The team won a Civil Service Award, jointly with the Foreign
			Office, for their approach, which relied on tools, techniques and code I co-developed and open-sourced.</p>

		<p>Due to the departure of a colleague I also briefly &amp; simultaneously managed another team during a
			challenging period. I was responsible for an additional thirty staff and £200&thinsp;million of overseas
			development aid.</p>

		<h3>Deputy Director, Strategy</h3>

		<p>I ran a twelve-person team that considered what needed to be done to meet the department's long-term targets.
			The team won a Civil Service Award for its ground-breaking approach which relied, in part, on code I developed.
		</p>

		<h3>Grade 6, Head of Engineering Team</h3>

		<p>I formed and ran the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change's first central engineering team. This team of
			ten spanned the engineering disciplines and provided technical advice to the department on carbon capture
			&amp; storage, bioenergy sustainability, nuclear research, spending to support innovation, the potential for
			energy demand reduction and the challenges of renewables deployment.</p>

		<h3>Grade 7, Assistant to the Chief Scientific Advisor</h3>

		<p>I was recruited to the UK Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change by David MacKay, the Chief Scientific
			Advisor, to work in his private office. I supported him with counsel and rapid analysis, helped
			track initiatives inside and outside of the department and represented him when he was unavailable.</p>

		<h2>STRATEGY MANAGER (2007&ndash;2010)</h2>

		<p>I was appointed as a strategy associate and then promoted to strategy manager at the Carbon Trust. I managed
			internal and external staff to create well-received publications on climate change topics and to help the CEO
			and COO to define elements of the Carbon Trust’s organisation and strategy. I represented the Carbon Trust
			to industry and to government in the UK and abroad. I kept Carbon Trust staff briefed on policy developments,
			such as the work of the Climate Change Committee, the carbon targets and budgets, and the Low Carbon Transition
			Plan.</p>

		<h2>ENGINEERING RESEARCHER (2003&ndash;2007)</h2>

		<p>I completed a PhD under the supervision of Dr Julian Allwood at the Department of Engineering at the
			University of Cambridge. I won personal funding for the research which considered whether it would be possible
			to remove print from paper in a way that would allow used sheets to be fed back into a printer and
			immediately reused. I published four peer-reviewed journal articles. </p>

		<h2>ENGINEERING TEACHER (2003&ndash;2007)</h2>

		<p>I was appointed as a teaching assistant at the Cambridge University Engineering Department. I led visits,
			practicals, workshops and educational games for third- and fourth-year engineering students. I marked
			essays. I prepared and delivered lectures and supervised undergraduate engineers.</p>

		<h2>STRATEGY CONSULTANT (2000&ndash;2003)</h2>

		<p>I was appointed as an associate consultant and then promoted to consultant (their post-MBA level) at Marakon
			Associates. I managed small consulting teams and large groups of clients to answer questions of strategy and
			organisation. My role became one of analytical troubleshooter sent in to give drifting projects traction.
			Most work was done overseas.</p>

		<h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEER (1995&ndash;2010)</h2>

		<p>While studying, I ran a small software business. I developed: one of the first content management systems for
			the web; a prototype electronic health record system; several platforms for booking events; several wikis; a
			popular system for finding out what seminars and talks are happening at the University of Cambridge; and an
			iPhone application to help breastfeeding mothers.</p>

		<h2>PROJECT MANAGER (1995&ndash;2000)</h2>

		<p>I was sponsored through university as a project manager in the Defence Engineering and Science Group, part of
			the Ministry of Defence. I ran small technical projects for Westland aerospace special projects; the Guided
			Weapons and Surveillance Technical Support group and the Battle Group Battle Management Systems team.</p>
